**CyberWalk**
  The step-based Role-Play game, made simple with Windows.Forms. Your aim is to defeat 3 bosses.
Implemented as a fan-project, with open-source resourses.

  As a stranger, you arrived to a big cyberpunk city and already felt to a trouble, which made other serious people hunt you.
  On your way, you'll meet different situations, that will require solutions from you. 
  An RPG part of it is that some of solutions will lead you to different consequences. And change some of stats, on which the futute relationship to you from city will be based.
For example, some of solutions may be locked or unlocked, depending on role you play. Neutral,evil or kind. 
  Some of solutions may require a bit of resourses, which are given for... surprise! Your solutions as well.\
  The boss fights are the lines of situations as well(battle). It is possible to win it - tested, don't be shy.
